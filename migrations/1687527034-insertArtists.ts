    description: `Defined by melancholy and experimentation, Alix Perez's time with Shogun Audio saw the Belgium-born artist deliver an extensive catalogue of music that immaculately captured the raw, soulful, and iconic sound of the mid-2000s drum and bass era, as well as delving into the deeper side of his sonic palette that has since become a focal point of his music.

    Emerging into the drum and bass circuit in 2005, Perez released his debut album "1984" on the label in 2009, going on to play a key part in the label's DNA over the years. From there, he went on to release his second studio album "Chroma Chords" in 2013, cementing his position as an artist that never failed to galvanize the imagination of listeners through the meaning deeply embedded in his sound.

    In 2016, Alix launched his own imprint in the form of 1985 Music. He has since relocated to New Zealand but continues to push the boundaries of electronic music through both his label and original productions.`,

Their debut album for Metalheadz Timeline dropped at the end of last yeargaining widespread critical acclaim and the outstanding follow-up EP “Shrine” which hit the official national charts this summer, are testament to their unrivalled heavyweight status.

In that same year their single "Uprising" was voted by the public as the biggest DnB track of the year (BBC Radio 1).

    description: `Austrian drum'n'bass duo Camo & Krooked were founded in 2007. Both (born Reinhard Rietsch on April 23, 1983 in Salzburg) and Krooked (born Markus Wagner on July 31, 1989 in Lilienfeld) had been active since 2002, before they teamed up and released their first singles from 2008 onward. Their first album, Above & Beyond, was released in 2010 and introduced their blend of drum'n'bass enriched with house, dubstep, and fun. At that year's Drum & Bass Arena Awards, they won the Best Newcomer DJ award. Their sophomore album, Cross the Line, appeared a year later on Hospital Records, and a remix album, Between the Lines, followed in 2012. With the release of their third studio album, Zeitgeist, in 2013, Camo & Krooked made their debut in the Austrian album charts, coming in at number 22. The duo became well-known for their patented “anti-drop” style, and their profile gradually increased as they performed all over the world, released a slew of singles, and turned in numerous remixes for everyone from Metronomy to Lana Del Rey. Their fourth album would not appear until 2017, as they toiled to create a fresh sound. Entitled Mosaik and released on Ram Records, it was pop-oriented and melodic, stadium drum'n'bass stripped back to its essence. The single “If I Could” featured previously unknown British singer Joe Killington.`,

    With both Tom and Jonathan having a background in music - clearly displaying itself in their sound, the duo initially began working together during their time at the University of Leicester. Signing exclusively to Shogun Audio in 2017, their single 'Lucid' grabbed the attention of BBC Radio 1 legend, Annie Mac, after receiving its radio premiere from Rene La Vice on the Drum and Bass show - he dubbed the track as a 'baby maker' which sums up the exuberant inviting tones in their production.

    2020 saw GLXY release their debut album 'Research & Development'. This first extended body of work, which included an outstanding collaboration with DRS in the form of 'She Sings For Me', cemented itself as a project defined by both its heavy emphasis on introspection and musicality.

    description: `Jonathan Immanuel Kievit (born 14 November 1998), known professionally as Imanu (stylized as IMANU), formerly as Signal is a French-born Dutch DJ, record producer and musician.

    After being exposed to trance and progressive house by a friend at the age of 10, Kievit started producing house at the age of 14. A few years later he discovered the music by Dutch trio Noisia and subsequently started producing drum and bass. Eventually, Dutch drum and bass artist Fre4knc also sent a song by Kievit to Noisia, who then signed him under the alias Signal to their label Invisible Recordings when Kievit was only 16 years old. In 2018 Kievit co-founded the record label Dividid (stylized as DIVIDID) with Mark McCann, better known as Abis and Rotterdam-based promoter Lars Dingeman.

    In 2019 Kievit started a new project under the alias "Imanu", which has since been active. As Imanu he pushed the boundaries of drum and bass as a genre and explored other genres, such as house, techno and footwork. He described his style of music as "future breaks" and cited Flume as his primary influence besides Sophie, Cashmere Cat and Arca.

    Since starting with Imanu, Kievit has released music on significant electronic music labels such as Zeds Dead's Deadbeats, Noisia's Vision Recordings, and UKF Music and has collaborated with Noisia, What So Not, Kuc̆ka, Josh Pan and Pham.

    In 2021, Beatport named Kievit as one of six Beatport NEXT artists, supporting him for a full year by offering store featurings, playisting, editorial features, live-streams and social media support.

    In June 2022, Kievit announced his debut album 'UNFOLD', which was released on September 16th, 2022 on Deadbeats.`,

    description: `North Carolina-born artist Travis Stewart, known as Machinedrum, occupies a unique place in US electronic music. A pioneer and a populariser, a restless and relentless seeker, Stewart brings together coasts and continents in projects which are both conceptual and heartfelt, clever and banging. He has produced and composed over a dozen albums under various aliases since his first independent release in 1999. Covering an astonishing variety of styles with ease, through solo Machinedrum work and with collaborative projects Sepalcure, JETS, Dream Continuum, or other mutations, Stewart has established himself as electronic music's true Renaissance man. His debut as Machinedrum, Now You Know, was released in 2001 on pioneering Miami-based Merck Records and gained worldwide attention and praise from musicians, fans and critics. Having a strong background in both acoustic and electronic instrumentation, he was quickly able to navigate those various elements on his early releases, from field recording and vintage synth-laden Urban Biology to his seminal production and mixing of This Charming Mixtape with MC Theophilus London and his critically acclaimed 2009 album Want To 1 2?

    2010's Many Faces EP ushered the next phase of Machinedrum's career and a fruitful relationship with Glasgow-based label LuckyMe. Sepalcure, a duo launched with Praveen Sharma (aka Braille) shortly after, became one of the most intriguing names in the bass music scene and a series of releases on bubbling imprint Hotflush has given the duo US-ambassadorship of this UK-based genre. Relocating to Berlin for a few years, Machinedrum maintained a steady flow of releases including the Alarmaa and SXLND EPs with LuckyMe and the critically-acclaimed Room(s) LP on Planet Mu Records, a fresh new exploration of juke, jungle, and drum & bass that garnered high praise across the music world. The dance floor blitzkrieg JETS, his latest project with longtime collaborator Jimmy Edgar, has kept him ahead of the curve, serving as yet another showcase for his musical evolution.

    Perhaps his boldest release came in the form of the full-length LP Vapor City on Ninja Tune, a conceptual universe which included an interactive website, digital citizenship program for fans, and an art exhibit in NYC that launched with the album. With subsequent EPs, exclusive remixes from a series of heavyweights including dBridge, Sherwood & Pinch and Om Unit, and a critically-acclaimed world tour, Vapor City carried on his rich exploration of multimedia arts and music. Since that record's release, he has collaborated with Jimmy Edgar (as JETS) on The Chants EP; released Movin' Forward, a tribute EP in memory of footwork legend DJ Rashad; revisited his long-running collaboration with Braille as Sepalcure on the LP Folding Time, as well as delivered a bunch of superb remixes for acts including Rudimental and Daktyl.

    Then came “Human Energy” (2016), an album that “reflects a period of great change in my life. I moved across the country to a new city, I proposed to the girl of my dreams, I moved into a new house, bought a brand new computer and set off to write a new album.” Lighter, brighter, full of energy and warmth, with a stellar cast of guests, Human Energy took Machinedrum from an aficionado's best-kept secret to his rightful place amongst the biggest stars of American dance music.

    He returns in 2020 with a new album “A View of U”, out in October on Ninja Tune. A truly career defining record which features an incredible cast of collaborators including Sub Focus, Chrome Sparks, Father (Awful Records), Freddie Gibbs, Mono/Poly (Brainfeeder), Tigran Hamasyan, Jesse Boykins III, Rochelle Jordan and Tanerélle. “A View of U” distills his signature fusion of IDM, UK rave, jungle and bass culture blended with myriad US regional hip-hop and club music styles.

    Stewart puts his unique signature on everything he touches, carving out a career as a world-class producer on top of releasing solo material and remixes. He has additionally collaborated with the likes of DJ Rashad, DJ Spinn, D∆WN, Lone, Theophilus London, Azealia Banks, Roots Manuva, Rosie Lowe, Lazer Sword, Jesse Boykins III, Jacques Greene, Animals As Leaders, Nick Hook, Rochelle Jordan and Angelica Bess to name but a few. Held in high esteem by his peers, Machinedrum has also remixed artists right across the musical spectrum including Solange, Bonobo, Kelis, Rudimental, Jamie Lidell, Chrome Sparks, DJ Shadow, Barker & Baumecker, Sherwood & Pinch, Noisia, SBTRKT, The Glitch Mob, Eprom, Stray and even Johnny Cash.`,

    description: `Based out of Linz, north Austria, Martin Schober is a singular protagonist at the forefront of this beguiling game we call drum & bass. He likes hip-hop, skateboarding, schnitzel, Leibniz biscuits and long walks in the sunset, but he's most respected for how he traipses across electronic music's wildest terrains with total boundary abandonment… And is regarded as a leading influential new-gen figure in the genre.

    From his agenda-setting halftime twist of 'Sunday Crunk' to his rolling, emotional collabo cameo on Camo & Krooked's acclaimed album 'Mosaik'. From his entrance into the Fabriclive mix hall of fame with a mix album comprising entirely of his own productions ('Fabriclive 95') to his Drum&BassArena Award-winning debut album 'Emulation', Mefjus's signature sound has been felt across the furthest expanses of the genre since he emerged in the early 2010s.

    Now working closely with Vision - the label run by kindred studio spirits Noisia - Mefjus continues to fine-tune his musical syntax, technical dexterity, eye for detail and deft groove sensibilities. The latest chapter to savour this on-going flux of development is his second album 'Manifest'.

    Released April 2018, 'Manifest' is the sound of Mefjus 2.0. After several years in the studio wilderness, exploring the dark science of song structure, musicality and textural contrasts, 'Manifest' captures a new mindset for Mefjus. Raw, energetic, playful and subversive, 'Manifest' is the most personal, diverse and daring body of work to date. Not so much as reminder of why he occupies such a unique position in drum & bass but a straight-up statement of intent.

    So now you know. And knowledge is power. Thanks for reading.`,

    With their debut album This Time Last Year on their Soulvent Records imprint putting the duo firmly on the map, and their sophomore album Lost in Thought on Shogun Audio being nominated for best album in the Drum&BassArena Awards, it comes as no surprise to find the pair in high demand. In a matter of years, Pola & Bryson have already been enlisted to remix the likes of Moby, Wilkinson and Camo & Krooked as well as collaborating on an EP with the veteran DJ Marky. And do we even need to mention the duo's bootleg of Adam F's "Circles" that has quite literally been played in every rave imaginable.

    While most producers take years to write their next album, Pola & Bryson are now fresh off the back of their third studio album 'Beneath the Surface' on Shogun. A conceptual album written to an imagined landscape, this ambitious body of work has led to D&B legends such as Sub Focus claiming the duo are "leading the new wave of liquid drum and bass".

    description: `Jonathan "Jon" Gooch (born August 22, 1984) is a British electronic music producer, best known under the aliases Feed Me and Spor.

    Gooch first started releasing music under the Spor name in 2004. The project's propulsive, moody take on drum 'n bass and early neurofunk made him a cult favorite in the scene, releasing singles on influential labels like Lifted, UKF and Vision Recordings and contributing remixes for artists like Basement Jaxx and Muse.

    Feed Me, Gooch's most popular project, emerged in 2008 as an outlet for his electro house and dubstep work, debuting with the track "Mordez Moi." His first three EPs under the name, Feed Me's Big Adventure, To the Stars and Feed Me's Escape From Electric Mountain, established the project's energetic sound and propelled him to popularity in the scene with some help from deadmau5 and his label mau5trap.

    Gooch would go on to start a label of his own, Sotto Voce Records, where he would release his first full-length album under the Feed Me name, Calamari Tuesday, in 2013, and a Spor album called Caligo in 2015. Each project's broad intent has remained intact over the course of his discography, but over time Gooch's output as Feed Me adopted more experimental edges in line with his work as Spor (albeit with a more melodic twist), while his Spor work has adopted a level of production polish recognizable in his Feed Me tunes — the natural end result of switching between the two projects.

    After several more EPs under the Feed Me name, Gooch returned to mau5trap for the project's second album, High Street Creeps, in 2019. He'd follow it up with a string of singles before releasing a self-titled third album in 2021.

    Gooch's DnB releases proved more sporadic in the later 2010s, but the producer returned to his roots with the Black Eyed EP in 2016, the Anachronic EP four years later, and the Cave EP on mau5trap in 2022.`,

His distinct feel for tone, melody and composition have earned him admiration from fans, DJs and music lovers alike.

    Releases like 'Long Been Gone' and 'Higher Ground' (Ft. T.R.A.C.) cemented him as one of the top soulful D&B artists in the 2010s, leading him to start releasing longer projects focusing on deeper emotional musical journeys with an emphasis on sonic detail.

Joining the dots between soulful hip hop and D&B in his own trademark voice, the Detroit Haze EP and Kodak Dreams LP put a stamp on his longtime sound and vision with stunning effect - garnering love from both the D&B scene and larger beats scenes.

    The 4 piece assemble consists of Valentin, Etienne, Tom and Kévin. Each member bring their own area of expertise and point of view, geling together perfectly.

    Their musical influences are very diverse, from Hip Hop to Rock, from Reggae to Ambient, This is reflected in their productions with a wide range of diversity, alternating between soulful drum and bass and deep dubstep.

    2018 saw the release of their first EP on the French label 'Impact Music' which immediately captivated the bass music community. Subsequently, they quickly went on to release music with the respected labels Flexout Audio and Dispatch Recordings.

    Catching the attention of highly influential producer and DJ Alix Perez, 2019 saw them join his imprint 1985 Music collaborating with Hyroglifics and Monty. Cementing their place on the label, they later went onto release their 'About You' EP which paved the way for what was to come from the 4 piece collective.

    Like many producers, when the pandemic took hold of the world they found themselves in the studio more than ever - working on new music and running live streams to reach a worldwide audience. Shortly after this, they presented 'Dark Guru EP' in 2021 which received heavy support and high praise throughout the scene. Celebrating the success of this EP and the world reopening, Visages travelled acrocess Europe performing their music to their masses.

    Later that year saw the release of 'Hardware' a collaboration with Monty, Strategy & Pav4n which boosted their limelight even more. This track also made it on to the official soundtrack for the EASports FIFA game - which later went on to be the biggest selling video game in the world during 2022. This exposure yet again pushed Visages to the masses and to brand new audiences.

    2022 was one of the most pivotal years for the collective as they released more music than ever and toured around New Zealand and Europe with label head honcha Alix Perez.

    With the release of 'Hagakure EP', the world finally got their hands on 'Lunar Eclipse' arguably one their biggest tunes of the year which picked up a nomination at the Drum & Bass Arena Awards 2022 - despite being 50% 140 BPM. Ending the year with a band, they presented their debut mini-LP in the form of 'From Lead To Gold' with all tracks topping the Beatport chart for a month, it's no wonder they went on to be the biggest selling 140 / Deep Dubstep artist of the year on the platform.

    Looking ahead, Visages are armed with an array of new music and club and festival bookings across the world and they are showing absolutely no sign of slowing down.`,
